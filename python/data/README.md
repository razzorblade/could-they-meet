# Data
Data folder contains all additional files we need in order to correctly run the application. For now, there are two gazetteers to help determine, whether first name and surname are valid. One export of dump to work on smaller data and exported persons from dump by the algorithm.

Some files are ignored. In order to correctly run the application, you will have to run main script with RUN_SPLIT=True first. This will generate file that was gitignored.
